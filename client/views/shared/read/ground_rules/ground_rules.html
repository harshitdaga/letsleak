                The intention of LetsLeak is not to harm anyone or spread malicious rumours, as can be very easy to do in an anonymous platform. Anonymity is a very powerful tool. But, as they say with great power comes great responsibility.

            </p>
            <p><b>We request our users to follow some guidelines for the benefit of the entire LetsLeak community including you.</b></p>

                <li><b>Report abuse.</b> If you came across any post which you feel is inappropriate, offensive, hurts your or others’ sentiments, in short if it is not in the spirit of the LetsLeak community, please Report Abuse or {{>Links key="ContactUs" message="Contact Us"}}.
