                            If there is something itching to get out of you, you can post it {{>Links key="/" message="here"}}. Please ensure that you follow the {{>Links key="GroundRules" message="Ground Rules"}} (basically don’t post any threats, false or malicious information and you are good to go). You have the choice to open or close comments for your post and opt-for whether you want the post to vanish (using our expiry time feature).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can surf through the stream of leaks that flows in and like others’ post by clicking on <i class="entypo heart-empty"></i>beneath every post.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If there are some posts by other fellow users which you particularly like, you can bucket <span class="btn addtoBucketIcon"><span class="entypo bucket"></span><span class="entypo plus"></span></span> them so as to visit them later. You can create a private bucket that is visible only to you, a bucket that others can follow and a bucket to which others can add to.
                            You can read through your bucket-ed collection at leisure. Follow other public buckets and suggest additions to others’ buckets.

                        <p>LetsLeak is invitation based. You can drop your email-id in the request for invitation section. You will receive an invitation on the email-id provided by you with an invitation code. Only one account can be created for every email-id.

                    <span class="answer">
                        <p>LetsLeak stores your username linked to the email-id which was used to request an invitation in an encrypted manner to avoid LetsLeak team or any third-party individual to know your identity. Hence, incase you forget your password the security pin, provided at the time of account creation, helps you to reset your password. You can also update the security pin after creating an account.</p>

                        <p>On top of every post there is a Report Abuse link. On clicking it, a window will appear where you can choose why you think this post is inappropriate. Choose and submit.

                    <span class="question">What happens once I Report Abuse on a post?</span>
                    <span class="answer">
                        <p>
                            LetsLeak waits for some threshold number of abusive reports regarding the post. Once a considerable number of users Report Abuse on a post, it is brought under the manual review panel which then examine the post and decide if it was an abusive post or falsely marked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In case that inappropriate content is found, a warning mail is sent to the author of the post. If repeated reports are obtained against a particular user, the account is blocked permanently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However if a post is falsely reported, a warning mail is sent to the reporter(s) requesting them to be more cautious in future. If the account user still continues to raise false Report Abuses then an action as harsh as permanently blocking the account may be taken.

                    <span class="answer">
                        <p>A public bucket is visible to everyone. Further, while creating the bucket it has an option to allow others to add posts. On the contrary, if others cannot add posts to the bucket, followers will only get notification whenever a post is added to the bucket. A private bucket is a bucket that is visible only to you when you are logged into your LetsLeak account.</p>

                            A post with an expiry time set by the author cannot be added to bucket. That's why you dont see the <span class="btn addtoBucketIcon"><span class="entypo bucket"></span><span class="entypo plus"></span></span> option.
