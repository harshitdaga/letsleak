                All of us have been in the situation where we have had to hear or say, “Dude, please don’t tell this to anyone, and if you do, don’t say you heard this from me”. Many a times, we resort to not speaking in fear of judgement and reactions of others’. Despite a myriad of social networking websites there are instances when we keep things to ourselves. In fact, in our humble opinion, this could also be a result of pitching ourselves as a glitch-free untainted awesome public figure.

                On these lines, we decided, it is time that there was a platform where there are no friends, no foes. A place where you can confess, gossip and find the outlet for the Mr. Hyde in us, when the people around us only know of the Dr. Jekyll.

                However, neither is our intention to harm anyone or spread malicious rumours, as can be very easy to do in an anonymous platform. Anonymity is a very powerful tool. But, as they say with great power comes great responsibility. Hence, we have certain {{>Links key="GroundRules" message="Ground Rules"}} which we expect our users to follow at times. Go ahead, LetsLeak <i>Naughty nothings, Silly somethings</i>.
