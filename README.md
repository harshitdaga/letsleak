Welcome to LetsLeak!
===================

[http://harshitdaga.github.io/letsleak/](http://harshitdaga.github.io/letsleak/)

- In office many times we got to know confidential news which got leaked such as company getting acquired by some tech giant, employees going to be get fired, some awesome product we are working on … 
- In college we got to know some surprise quiz might be coming or paper got leaked, some confessions, views on college policy … 
- Political scandals, videos of people taking bribe …  
- And list is endless

Few people got to know about such leaks few others never ever get a chance to know such stuff. So our idea is to create a platform (Leak) where people can express/share their views/feelings/news in short any content [1] anonymously. 

> Why I believe such a system will ever work ?

We all have love to hear gossip, love to share stuff which is private or confidential or just want to share it to make peace with our mind but many times due to fear of our identities getting relieved we can't share them. And this basic nature of all of us will lead this idea work (atleast we hope :) ).

 **5. Buckets**
If there are some posts by other fellow users which you particularly like, you can bucket them so as to visit them later. You can create a private bucket that is visible only to you, a bucket that others can follow and a bucket to which others can add to. You can read through your bucket-ed collection at leisure. Follow other public buckets and suggest additions to others’ buckets.
